The vehicle rental system provides complete functionality of listing and booking vehicles.  
A vehicle rental is a vehicle that can be used temporarily for a fee during a specified period. Getting a rental car helps people despite the fact they do not have access to their own personal vehicle or do not own a vehicle at all. The individual who needs a car must contact a rental vehicle company which is owned by the hotel and contract out for a vehicle is processed only if the customer has a room booked in the same hotel.  

We have used MySQL for maintaining the database through PhpMyAdmin in the back end, and java for designing the front end. We have created Swing applications using java and used jframes to include buttons, text fields etc.
